Artefact for GDEV50037 - Ryan Moakes - m015485n - 23015485 
PROJECT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, NOT FOR COMMERICAL USE:

For some unknown reason, putting a zip folder of the solution onto a medium like OneDrive seems to break the solution and stops it from building entirely.

"Dotnet Restore Exited with code one"

I hope this doesn't happen when you are testing it but just in case:

Skip the build and run the previous build if prompted (Trust me, the build is fine)

For your convivence the exe files have been included with the submission, I encourage you to use solution to view the code whilst using the video and executables to test the game itself.

Or if you have access to the GitHub repo, a direct clone seems to build fine.

Thanks for your understanding.

Ryan.
